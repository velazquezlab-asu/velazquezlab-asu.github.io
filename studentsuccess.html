		I have worked under Dr. Velazquez’s mentorship for 7 years, and despite my graduation and departure from Arizona will continue to work with Ramon on projects that we have been collaborating on for over 5 years. In my 7 years in the Velazquez Lab, I refined my ability to write scientific literature, performed and designed complicated biochemical and bioinformatic experiments, and most of all gained a deep understanding of what it means to do good, rigorous science. During my time in the lab, I have been a second author on two papers <i>(Neurobiology of Aging, Molecular Psychiatry)</i> and a first author on two high-impact papers <i>(Acta Neuropathologica, Second Paper in Submission)</i>.
		<br><br>
		Outside of the lab, I worked in the Luminosity Lab - ASU’s highly-selective interdisciplinary research & development laboratory - where I led our portfolio of >10 projects around innovations in health and medicine. Here, I published two pre-print articles, submitted two pending patent applications, and led a team to win the $1M XPRIZE Next-Gen Mask Challenge, an international innovation competition drawing nearly 1,000 teams across 70 countries. I was also appointed to the Arizona Board of Regents by Arizona Governor Doug Ducey in 2020 to serve a two-year term on the governing board of Arizona’s three public universities. There, I served on the Research and Health Sciences Committee, as the Co-Chair of the Student Food and Housing Insecurity Working Group, and as the Assistant Treasurer.
		<br><br>
		Upon graduation, I am moving to Chicago to work as a Business Analyst for McKinsey & Company, the world’s premier management consulting firm. I hope to gain critical business acumen in my time at McKinsey and couple this with my robust experience in research and development in bioscience to bring new life-saving innovations to market in the future.

      <p class="w3-threequarter w3-opacity w3-padding">Under Dr. Velazquez's guidance the past two and a half years, I was granted the ability to not only learn more about the field of neuroscience, but understand the process behind innovative therapeutic targets and drug discovery. Through immersion in laboratory facilitation, projects and completion of my own honors thesis, I gained analytical and critical thinking skills that will benefit me in my future endeavors. Most importantly, I learned the responsibilities of what being a researcher entails and am extremely grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of new developments in the field of neurodegenerative diseases.
		<br><br>
        In Fall 2022, I will be attending Georgetown University to complete a Masters of Science in Global Health concentrated in Health Policy and Development prior to application to medical school.

      <p class="w3-threequarter w3-opacity w3-padding">Under Dr. Velazquez’s mentorship, I was able to get out of my comfort zone and really start being proactive and efficient not only in the lab, but also in my professional, academic, and personal life. I was able to challenge my intellectual abilities and gained the knowledge and skills to think outside of the box and contribute to the field of Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, I had the amazing opportunity to expand my laboratory skillset and learn more about neuroscience-related research and other fields such as hepatology. The opportunity of having someone who can relate to me, and my struggles, has been an inspiration that allowed me to work hard to achieve my goals, all while having fun throughout the process. Working in this lab has been nothing but a pleasure, and I thank everyone for such a memorable stage in my career.
        <br><br>
        In the Fall of 2022, I will be attending Medical School. Although I have not yet decided on the institution I will be attending, my top choices are the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai, University of Arizona College of Medicine Tucson, University of Illinois College of Medicine, and Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson College of Medicine.

      <p class="w3-threequarter w3-opacity w3-padding">Under Dr. Velazquez's mentorship, I had the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects exploring neurodegenerative disease processes and complete my honors thesis. I developed an appreciation for the scientific research process and gained valuable research, writing, presentation, and critical thinking skills that I will apply to my future research endeavors.
        <br><br>
        I am currently (2021) a medical student at the University of Arizona College of Medicine – Phoenix

Currently, I am a clinical researcher applying my learned skills and expertise to research related to the COVID-19 vaccine, Alzheimer's disease and dementia. 
        <br><br>
        In Fall 2021, I will be attending Georgetown University in pursuit of a Master of Science in Nursing degree, with the ultimate goal of promoting health equity and social justice in healthcare
