      <h3><u>The Velazquez Lab is seeking applications for the competitive Edson postdoctoral fellow</u></h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">
        We invite applications for an Edson Foundation Postdoctoral Research Scholar in the ASU Neurodegenerative
        Disease Research Center (NDRC) at Arizona State University’s. The NDRC is a center in the world renown Biodesign
        Institute and the fellowship would be in the laboratory of Dr. Ramon Velazquez. Under the direction of founding
        director Dr. Jeffrey Kordower, the goal of the Edson Foundation and NDRC is to fund research and scholars that
        will aid in new discoveries and solutions to better the quality of life for people affected by neurodegenerative
        diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.<br><br>
        The selected candidate will work in the Velazquez laboratory, which is focused on identifying early molecular
        events that are triggered by environmental factors that accelerate disease. This lab is also interested in drug
        discovery and dietary supplementation of B-like vitamins as a method to prevent disease progression.
        Additionally, the lab has a strong focus on understanding why individuals with Down Syndrome (a genetic disorder
        resulting in intellectual disabilities) show an increase prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. The Velazquez lab
        uses a variety of model systems, including invitro cell models of disease, transgenic rodent models, and both
        nonhuman primate and human tissue from patients.<br><br>
        We will begin reviewing applications May 15th, 2023 and will continue to review incoming applications on a
        biweekly basis until the position is filled.<br><br>

      <p class="w3-opacity">Given that the elderly is the fastest growing population in our society and that age is the
        single most important risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), there is an urgent need to understand the
        mechanisms contributing to AD pathology. Doing so, we will be able to develop strategies by which we can prevent
        the incidence of AD, as well as help those that are currently in advanced stages of this disease. One of the
        most fruitful approaches for studying neurodegenerative diseases stems from utilizing a multidisciplinary
        strategy. Dr. Velazquez graduate and early postdoctoral studies have shaped him into a well-rounded
        neuroscientist with this type of multidisciplinary approach, as he received extensive training in behavioral
        neuroscience, animal models of disease, neurobiology and molecular neuroscience. This allows the VLoND team to
        ask questions at multiple levels of analysis. The VLoND ultimate goal is to progress science while consecutively
        helping those who suffer from Neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

            <p class="w3-opacity">Neurodegenerative illnesses, such as Alzheimer’s disease, are among the most

              contaminants have also been implicated as possible players in the development or advancement of
              neurodegenerative disease. Among these is a broad-spectrum herbicide, known as glyphosate. Glyphosate is
              commonly used herbicide, applied to agricultural crops around the world.<br><br>In a new study, first
              author Joanna Winstone, senior author Ramon Velazquez, and their colleagues at the Translational Genomics
              Research Institute (TGen) explore the effects of glyphosate exposure on the brains of mice. The research
              demonstrates, for the first time, that glyphosate successfully crosses the blood-brain barrier and
              infiltrates the brain. Once there, it acts to enhance levels of a critical factor known as TNF-α, (for

            <p class="w3-opacity">Arizona State University researchers are looking at the nutrient choline as a way to
              prevent Alzheimer’s disease. Research with mice shows that choline helps reduce the activation of
              microglia, specialized cells that rid the brain of debris. When over activated, microglia can lead to
              neuronal death and brain inflammation. Choline also blocks production of amyloid-beta plaques, caused by
              the protein fragment beta-amyloid, which can lead to nerve cell death. Ramon Velazquez, a lead author of
              the new study and a researcher in the ASU-Banner Neurodegenerative Disease Research Center, tells us

            <h3>More choline for mom decreases Down syndrome effects</h3>
            <h5><i>September 11, 2013</i></h5>
            <p class="w3-opacity">Down syndrome fetuses dramatically benefit when their mothers increase their intake of
              the nutrient choline during pregnancy and nursing, report Cornell researchers in the journal Neurobiology
              of Disease. Increased choline by moms bolsters brain functions and plays a profound health role for Down
              syndrome offspring throughout their lives. Increased maternal choline intake improves spatial cognition
              and attention, and delays aging-related memory decline in normal laboratory rats. The present findings
              with Down syndrome mice indicate that increased maternal choline consumption may also lessen the
              impairment of individuals with Down syndrome and reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, which is seen in
              nearly all Down syndrome individuals.<a
