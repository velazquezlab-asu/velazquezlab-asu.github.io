    <p class="w3-opacity">Given that the elderly is the fastest growing population in our society and that age is the single most important risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms contributing to AD pathology. Doing so, we will be able to develop strategies by which we can prevent the incidence of AD, as well as help those that are currently in advanced stages of this disease. One of the most fruitful approaches for studying neurodegenerative diseases stems from utilizing a multidisciplinary strategy. Dr. Velazquez graduate and early postdoctoral studies have shaped him into a well-rounded neuroscientist with this type of multidisciplinary approach, as he received extensive training in behavioral neuroscience, animal models of disease, neurobiology and molecular neuroscience. This allows the VLoND team to ask questions at multiple levels of analysis. The VLoND ultimate goal is to progress science while consecutively helping those who suffer from Neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

          <h5><i>July 27, 2022</i></h5>
          <p class="w3-opacity">Neurodegenerative illnesses, such as Alzheimer’s disease, are among the most perplexing in medical science. The underlying causes of such diseases range from genetic factors and overall cardiovascular health to dietary influences and lifestyle choices.<br><br>Various environmental contaminants have also been implicated as possible players in the development or advancement of neurodegenerative disease. Among these is a broad-spectrum herbicide, known as glyphosate. Glyphosate is commonly used herbicide, applied to agricultural crops around the world.<br><br>In a new study, first author Joanna Winstone, senior author Ramon Velazquez, and their colleagues at the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) explore the effects of glyphosate exposure on the brains of mice. The research demonstrates, for the first time, that glyphosate successfully crosses the blood-brain barrier and infiltrates the brain. Once there, it acts to enhance levels of a critical factor known as TNF-α, (for tumor necrosis factor alpha).<a href="https://biodesign.asu.edu/neurodegenerative-disease/news-and-events/story/new-study-shows-that-a-commonly-used-agricultural-herbicide-crosses-the-blood-brain-barrier/"><br><br><b>Click to read the full article</b></a></p>

          <h5><i>May 12, 2021</i></h5>
          <p class="w3-opacity">Since the discovery of Alzheimer’s disease over a century ago, two hallmarks of the devastating illness have taken center stage. The first, known as amyloid plaques, are dense accumulations of misfolded amyloid protein, occurring in the spaces between nerve cells. Most efforts to halt the advance of Alzheimer’s disease have targeted amyloid protein plaques.

          <h3>ASU researchers looking at common supplement to battle Alzheimer’s</h3>
          <h5><i>October 8, 2019</i></h5>
          <p class="w3-opacity">Arizona State University researchers are looking at the nutrient choline as a way to prevent Alzheimer’s disease. Research with mice shows that choline helps reduce the activation of microglia, specialized cells that rid the brain of debris. When over activated, microglia can lead to neuronal death and brain inflammation. Choline also blocks production of amyloid-beta plaques, caused by the protein fragment beta-amyloid, which can lead to nerve cell death. Ramon Velazquez, a lead author of the new study and a researcher in the ASU-Banner Neurodegenerative Disease Research Center, tells us more.<a href="https://azpbs.org/horizon/2019/10/asu-researchers-looking-at-common-supplement-to-battle-alzheimers/?fbclid=IwAR0euN5l_CgP4r7pn_l2XDGY6RCinwliK_5XHh5e6Ff2nRfLBtFTEy7G2NY"><br><br><b>Click to watch the video</b></a></p>

          <h3>Common nutrient supplementation may hold the answers to combating Alzheimer's disease</h3>
          <h5><i>September 27, 2019</i></h5>
          <p class="w3-opacity">In a new study, Biodesign researchers reveal that a lifelong dietary regimen of choline holds the potential to prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD). Choline is a safe and easy-to-administer nutrient that is naturally present in some foods and can be used as a dietary supplement. Lead author Ramon Velazquez and his colleagues at the ASU-Banner Neurodegenerative Disease Research Center (NDRC) looked into whether this nutrient could alleviate the effects of Alzheimer's.<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/09/190927122526.htm"><br><br><b>Click to read the full article</b></a></p>

          <h5><i>January 8, 2019</i></h5>
          <p class="w3-opacity">Researchers are exploring a safe and simple treatment for one of the most devastating and perplexing afflictions: Alzheimer's disease (AD). They are investigatign the effects of choline, an important nutrient that may hold promise in the war against the memory-stealing disorder. The study focuses on mice bred to display Alzheimer’s-like symptoms. Results demonstrate that when these mice are given high choline in their diet, their offspring show improvements in spatial memory, compared with those receiving a normal choline regimen in the womb.<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190108084424.htm"><br><br><b>Click to read the full article on Science Daily</b></a><br><a href="https://news.asu.edu/20190108-essential-nutrient-may-help-fight-alzheimers-across-generations"><b>Click to read the full article on ASU News</b></a></p>

          <h3>More choline for mom decreases Down syndrome effects</h3>
          <h5><i>September 11, 2013</i></h5>
          <p class="w3-opacity">Down syndrome fetuses dramatically benefit when their mothers increase their intake of the nutrient choline during pregnancy and nursing, report Cornell researchers in the journal Neurobiology of Disease. Increased choline by moms bolsters brain functions and plays a profound health role for Down syndrome offspring throughout their lives. Increased maternal choline intake improves spatial cognition and attention, and delays aging-related memory decline in normal laboratory rats.  The present findings with Down syndrome mice indicate that increased maternal choline consumption may also lessen the impairment of individuals with Down syndrome and reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, which is seen in nearly all Down syndrome individuals.<a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2013/09/more-choline-mom-decreases-down-syndrome-effects"><br><br><b>Click to read the full article</b></a></p>
